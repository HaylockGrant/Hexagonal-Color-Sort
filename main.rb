# Time to ramble
# I need to render a hexagonal grid
# a circular hexagonal grid
# the equation for the size a certain 'length' of grid can hold is F(n) = 1 + 6 ((n(n-1)/2)
# to calculate the size of the grid you need you need to use the quadradic formula, choose the positive option, then round up
# Great. now we have a grid. I don't know how to render it in cartesian style for ya know. a compter screen, but I choose to use the Axial coordinates system
# I also plan on locking the blackest paint in the middle
# To sort the colors I'm going to use the color 

#Quote from https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/
#  The axial coordinate system, sometimes called “trapezoidal” or “oblique” or “skewed”,
#  is the same as the cube system except we don't store the s coordinate. Since we have 
#  a constraint q + r + s = 0, we can calculate s = -q-r when we need it.
#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centered_hexagonal_number to calculate the size of the hexagon needed

#Colorspace is quite the complex thing... I'm not sure what I'm going to do to integrate everythin

#I'd like to use gosu for the renderer
